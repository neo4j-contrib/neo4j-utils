1.1 (2010-08-03)
----------------

o Added a relationshipExistsBetween (between two nodes) which can spawn
  a thread going from the other side at the same time if there should be
  many relationships from the first side.
o Removed utilities for the old event framework, since they were removed
  from the kernel.
o Added a NodeStack class.
o Removed almost all transaction handling, it was inconsistently scattered
  all over the code.
o Removed the passing of GraphDatabaseService references from many places,
  it can now be retrieved from PropertyContainer#getGraphDatabase() instead.
