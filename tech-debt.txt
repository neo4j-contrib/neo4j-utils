[2010-02-09] Package names are not descriptive
    This component contains a lot of useful utilities. But catagorizing them
    all as "utils" hides the usefulness, it would be better to divide this
    into a number of components based on the purpose of each set of classes.

[2010-02-10] Tests doesn't cover all the code
    The tests in this component doesn't cover all, only most of the code.
    Some examples of these:
    * org.neo4j.util.Migration/Migrator
    * org.neo4j.util.NodeQueueWorker
    * org.neo4j.util.TransactionNodeQueue/+Worker
